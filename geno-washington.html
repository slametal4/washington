            Geno Washington (born William Francis Washington; December 21, 1943, in Evansville, Indiana) is an American R&amp;B singer who released five albums with the Ram Jam Band between 1966 and 1969, and eight solo albums beginning in 1976.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Washington was stationed in England with the United States Air Force during the early 1960s. While stationed in East Anglia, Washington became known as a frequent stand-in at gigs around London. When guitarist Pete Gage saw him at a nightclub in 1965, he asked Washington to join his new group, that was to become Geno Washington &amp; the Ram Jam Band.  Gage later formed Vinegar Joe with Elkie Brooks and Robert Palmer.  The band's name came from the Ram Jam Inn, an old coaching inn on the A1 (Great North Road) at Stretton, near Oakham, Rutland.<br/><br/>The group had two of the biggest selling UK albums of the 1960s, both of which were live albums. Their most commercially successful album, Hand Clappin, Foot Stompin, Funky-Butt ... Live!, was in the UK Albums Chart for 38 weeks in 1966 and 1967, peaking at number 5 on the chart.  The other album was Hipster Flipsters Finger Poppin' Daddies, which reached number 8 on the UK album chart.
