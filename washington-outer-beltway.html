            The Washington Outer Beltway was a proposed freeway that would have extended further out than the Capital Beltway and encircled Washington, D.C. through the states of Maryland and Virginia.  Most of the route was canceled in the 1980s. Parts of it have been built as the Fairfax County Parkway in Virginia, as well as Interstate 370 and the Intercounty Connector in Maryland.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Initial plans were developed in the 1950s for the proposed 122-mile (196 km) Washington Outer Beltway. The National Capital Park and Planning Commission issued a Comprehensive Plan for the Nation's Capital and Its Environs in 1950. The comprehensive plan included three different circular roads in and around the District of Columbia. The original Outer Beltway had been planned to pass south of the corporate limits of the City of Rockville, as shown on a map published in The Washington Post in 1951 with the caption "Ring Road suggested by Bureau of Public Roads". In 1953, the portion of the Outer Beltway between Montgomery County and Prince George's County was included in the Master Plan of Highways of the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission. It was later included in the Commission's General Plan in 1957, and the Commission's On Wedges and Corridors plan in 1964.<br/><br/>In the 1960s, an "outer circumferential highway" was proposed between 5 and 10 miles (8.0 and 16.1 km) outside the Capital Beltway.
