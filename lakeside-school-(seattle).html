            Lakeside School is a private school located in Seattle, Washington, for grades 5–12. As of 2024, school review website Niche ranked Lakeside School as the best private high school in Washington state and the 52nd best private high school in the United States. Niche also ranked Lakeside as the 28th best high school for STEM in the United States.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The Moran-Lakeside School was an independent prep school for boys established in 1919 by Frank G. Moran on the shores of Lake Washington in the Denny-Blaine neighborhood of Seattle. The school was intended to feed students to Moran's other school, the Moran School on nearby Bainbridge Island. The school was incorporated in 1923 by a group of parents and renamed to Lakeside Day School. It moved a year later to the present site of The Bush School in Washington Park.<br/><br/>A site near Northeast 145th Street in northern Seattle was selected in 1929 for a new campus for the Lakeside Day School, which had outgrown the Washington Park campus. Four buildings were constructed, including dormitories for 30 students and a refectory. The campus opened on September 4, 1930; a year later, the school was renamed to the Lakeside School.
