            Washougal ( wah-SHOO-gəl) is a city in Clark County, Washington, United States. The population was 17,039 as of the 2020 census.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Etymology ==<br/><br/>The name Washougal originated from a Chinookan term of disputed meaning that was recorded by fur trader Alexander Ross in 1811 as "Wasough-ally"; other variants included "Washougally", "Washougally Camp", "Wa-Shu-Go", and "Washookal".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The area around present-day Washougal was originally home to the Watlala, an indigenous Chinookan-speaking group with settlements along the Columbia River. Among the first non-indigenous people to visit the area were the Corps of Discovery led by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark in 1805 and 1806; they camped near the Washougal River during their return voyage in April 1806 and tentatively named it the "Seal River" and "Seacalf River".<br/><br/>English sailor Richard Ough (also spelled Howe) built a home in what would become present-day Washougal sometime between 1838 and 1841; he had arrived in the area to work at Fort Vancouver for the Hudson's Bay Company and later married the daughter of Cascade Chinook chief Schluyhus. Ough was followed in 1844 by a cohort led by David C. Parker, who built Parker's Landing and claimed 580 acres (230 ha) under the Donation Land Claim Act; among the settlers was George Bush, among the first African American settlers in the Pacific Northwest. Parker's Landing, later renamed Parkersville, unsuccessfully applied for incorporation in 1852 or 1854; by this time, it had a hotel, bar, and a store and was a trading post along the river. A public school—claimed to be the first American school north of the Columbia River—was established in 1852–53. A portion of Ough's own claim was sold to Joseph E. C. Durgin, who established a townsite in 1880 that was named Washougal; the new settlement overtook Parkersville and was platted on May 6, 1880.
