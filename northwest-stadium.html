            Northwest Stadium is an American football stadium in Landover, Maryland, United States, located 5 miles (8 km) east of Washington, D.C. It is the home stadium of the Washington Commanders of the National Football League (NFL). From 2004 until 2010, it had the NFL's largest seating capacity at 91,000; it currently seats 62,000. The stadium is owned and operated by the Commanders, with non-NFL events managed by Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment (HBSE). The stadium opened in 1997 as Jack Kent Cooke Stadium. It was known as FedExField from 1999 until 2024, when FedEx relinquished its sponsorship. The stadium was briefly known as Commanders Field before Northwest Federal Credit Union bought naming rights.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>By the early 1990s, Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke sought to replace RFK Stadium as the team's stadium. Cooke considered a site next to Laurel Park Racecourse along Whiskey Bottom and Brock Bridge roads, but lack of parking and public support prompted him to choose to build instead on Wilson Dairy Farm in Landover, Maryland. A special exit, Exit 16 (initially Arena Drive, later renamed Medical Center Drive), was built from Interstate 495, also known as the Capital Beltway. Cooke named the site Raljon after his sons Ralph and John, registering it with the United States Postal Service for the stadium's ZIP Code.
