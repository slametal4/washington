            Oroville is a city located in the northern bulk of the Okanogan Highlands in north-central Washington, United States. Oroville is a member municipality of Okanogan County, Washington situated between Omak and Penticton. The population was 1,795 at the 2020 census.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Oroville was first settled by European settlers in the late 1850s and known as 'rag town.' The settlement was named Oro, after the Spanish word for gold, in 1892 after the surrounding gold mines and in an attempt to attract prospectors and merchants. The Post Office objected to the name "Oro" because a town was already named "Oso" in Washington, so the name was changed to Oroville, in 1909. Oroville was a stop along the Spokane Falls and Northern Railway line from British Columbia to Spokane, via Molson and Chesaw. In 1914 a third branch south to Wenatchee was constructed to avoid the steep inclines on the original Spokane track.<br/><br/>Passenger train service to Oroville was operated by the Great Northern Railway until July 14, 1953, with freight operations continuing later.<br/><br/>Oroville started to become a tourist location in the mid-2000s, large condo developments were proposed. After peaking in 2005–07, the city’s economy has suffered since the Great Recession of 2008.
