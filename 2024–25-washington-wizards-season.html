            The 2024–25 Washington Wizards season was the 64th season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and 51st in the Washington, D.C. area. Brian Keefe, who served as the interim head coach the previous season following the firing of Wes Unseld Jr., was hired as the fulltime coach during the offseason.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>The previous season ended on the lowest-ever note for the Washington Wizards franchise, with a 15–67 record through the regular season, including an 0–4 record in the group stage of the new 2023 NBA In-Season Tournament, and a 16-game losing streak. The only team to perform worse during that season was the Detroit Pistons, who finished with a 14–68 record, including a record-high 28-game losing streak. Continuing their rebuild, the new front office prioritized finding and developing youth talent. The team decided to make Brian Keefe, who finished the season as the interim head coach after Wes Unseld Jr.'s removal, the full-time head coach for the season. <br/><br/>The Wizards also made multiple trades to land multiple picks in present and future drafts. After winning the #2 overall pick through the lottery, and a pair of draft-night trades, the team finished the 2024 NBA draft with three first-round picks, selecting Alex Sarr, Bub Carrington, and Kyshawn George. In addition, Deni Avdija was sent to the Portland Trail Blazers to land Malcolm Brogdon, while Jonas Valančiūnas was acquired in a sign-and-trade deal with the New Orleans Pelicans. The Wizards then signed multiple players to lower-end contracts.
