<h1>The Plan (Washington, D.C.)</h1>
            
            The Plan is a conspiracy theory in Washington, D.C., which posits that since the enactment of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act in 1973, white people have had a "plan to take back" the black-majority city and the offices of the local government. The theory asserts that the decline of low-income black residents and their replacement by wealthier whites from outside of Washington, D.C., is intentional through the calculated use of gentrification and urban renewal. <br/><br/>While most within Washington, D.C., regard the Plan as false, the black population has fallen by about 25 percentage points, and the white population grown by about the same, in the period since the Home Rule Act was enacted. As of the 2020 census, black residents are no longer a majority in the district, but remain a plurality.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Lillian Wiggins, a columnist for the Washington Afro American newspaper, was the first to formally describe the conspiracy theory, writing in 1979 that "Many residents believe that the Marion Barry era may be the last time Washington will have a black mayor. If negative programming and characterization of black leadership are allowed to continue in the city of Washington and especially the black community, there is a strong possibility of the 'master plan' which I have so often spoken about maturing in the 1980s."  Some note that the Federal City Council, an organized group of civic and corporate leaders, mostly white, meets in secret and uses its power to influence the city's direction.  The theory particularly gained sway in the 1980s and early 1990s, as the city became increasingly unaffordable to low-income minorities. Urban renewal was also seen as intended to push out minority populations.<br/><br/>Anti-theorists note that instead of an organized conspiracy, there are market forces, demographics, and gentrification—which is happening quickly in the District of Columbia—at work.  Black residents have left the District, similar to how many white residents moved to the suburbs, beginning in the 1950s.
