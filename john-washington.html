            John Washington (1633 – 1677) was an English-born merchant, planter, politician and military officer. Born in Tring, Hertfordshire, he subsequently immigrated to the English colony of Virginia and became a member of the planter class. In addition to serving in the Virginia militia and owning several slave plantations, Washington also served for many years in the House of Burgesses, representing Westmoreland County. He was the first member of the Washington family to live in North America and was a paternal great-grandfather of George Washington, the first president of the United States.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and family ==<br/><br/>John Washington was born to rector Lawrence Washington and wife Amphillis Twigden, about 1633 (when his father resigned his fellowship at Oxford that required him to remain unmarried), likely at his maternal grandparents' home in Tring, Hertfordshire. However, as an adult, John Washington gave his age in a Virginia deposition as 45, which would put his birth two years earlier. Before his marriage Lawrence had been a don at the University of Oxford. He had been born at Sulgrave Manor near Banbury in Oxfordshire. <br/><br/>When John was eight, his father enrolled him in Charterhouse School in London to begin preparing for an academic career, but the boy never attended the school. In 1633 the senior Washington had left Oxford to become the rector of All Saints Parish in Purleigh, Essex.
