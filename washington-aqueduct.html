            The Washington Aqueduct is an aqueduct that provides the public water supply system serving Washington, D.C., and parts of its suburbs, using water from the Potomac River. One of the first major aqueduct projects in the United States, it was commissioned by the U.S. Congress in 1852, and construction began in 1853 under the supervision of Montgomery C. Meigs and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Portions of the aqueduct began operation on January 3, 1859, and the full pipeline began operating in 1864.: 68 <br/><br/>The system is owned and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and has been in continuous use ever since. It is listed as a National Historic Landmark. The Union Arch Bridge, which carries a portion of the aqueduct, is also listed as a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Design and facilities ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The centerpiece of the Aqueduct is a 12-mile (19 km) pipeline that connects the system's dam at Great Falls with the Dalecarlia Reservoir on the border with Montgomery County, Maryland. Portions of the Aqueduct went online on January 3, 1859, and the full pipeline began operating in 1864.: 68  The pipeline runs along what is now MacArthur Boulevard, traversing some of the higher cliffs along the Potomac River.<br/><br/>The Union Arch Bridge carries the pipeline and MacArthur Boulevard over Cabin John Creek and the Cabin John Parkway near the community of Cabin John, Maryland.  This bridge was the longest masonry arch bridge in the world for 40 years.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Dalecarlia Reservoir serves as a primary sedimentation basin.
