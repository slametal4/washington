            Dennis R. Washington (born 1934) is an American billionaire industrialist who owns, or co-owns controlling interests in, a large consortium of privately held companies collectively known as the Washington Companies and, in Canada, another collection of companies known as the Seaspan Marine Corporation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Born in Spokane, Dennis Washington grew up in Spokane, Bremerton, Washington, and Missoula, Montana. His parents separated when he was very young, and Washington lived with his mother. He rarely saw his father, who worked in construction overseas. Washington did not grow up in a wealthy family. Additionally, he states his parents' divorce as his motivation to provide his own wife and children with a stable family environment.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Following graduation from high school, Dennis Washington worked in construction in Alaska and Montana. He began his business career at age 30 in 1964, with a $30,000 loan and a single bulldozer . He created Washington Construction, which worked primarily on highway contracts, and by 1969 was the largest contractor in Montana.<br/><br/>In the 1970s he moved into mining and dam construction.
