            Maple Valley is a city in King County, Washington United States. The population was 28,013 at the 2020 census.  The city functions as a commuter town for residents, though there is an increasing amount of commercial activity in the area.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The area was settled in 1879 by three men who were improving a trail and brought their families in. When a name for a future community was proposed, the names Vine Maple Valley and Maple Ridge were suggested. A vote was taken by writing the names on slips of paper and placing them in a hat. Vine Maple Valley won by 2/3, but the word "Vine" was later cut by the post office because it made the name too long.<br/><br/>The town's early history mainly had to do with coal, lumber milling to build homes, and a railroad that ran through town. Coal was brought in from Black Diamond to the south, but the town itself also mined coal from Cedar Mountain. The mine was used as late as 1947.
