            Samuel Washington (November 16, 1734 – September 26, 1781) was an American planter, politician and military officer best known for being the younger brother of George Washington, the first president of the United States.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Washington was born in at his father's Wakefield Plantation on Pope's Creek, in Westmoreland County, Colony of Virginia, in November 1734. He was the second son born to Mary Ball Washington and Augustine Washington. George Washington was his eldest full brother, but he also had elder half brothers from this father's first marriage: Lawrence Washington and Augustine Washington Jr. (Jane Washington, his half-sister, died shortly after his birth.) His other full siblings were Elizabeth Washington Lewis, John Augustine Washington, Charles Washington and Mildred Washington (who died young).<br/><br/>His father died when he was eight years old, and unlike his elder brothers, he did not travel to Britain for higher education, but received the best education his family could afford in the neighborhood (there being no public schools in the era). From 1735 to 1738, he resided with his father, mother and siblings at Mount Vernon, then his father moved the family to Stafford County, where he was raised on Ferry Farm.<br/><br/>Samuel Washington suffered from tuberculosis for much of his life, and would ultimately die from the disease at age 46; three of his four sons who reached adulthood also died of that communicable disease.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Upon reaching legal age, Samuel Washington inherited two pieces of land from his father: one tract of 600 farmed acres in the Potomac River watershed drained by Chotank Creek in northern Stafford County a mile or two west of the Dahlgren Bridge, and a 1,200-acre undeveloped tract in the Rappahannock River watershed drained by Deep Run southwest of Fredericksburg. He ultimately sold these properties, using some of the proceeds to purchase land in the Shenandoah Valley (by September 1770 when he moved across the Blue Ridge mountains he owned 2,500 acres in what was then Frederick County and that in 1772 became Berkeley County).
