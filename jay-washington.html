            Anthony Jay Washington (born November 10, 1981) is a Filipino-American professional basketball player who last played for Yokohama Excellence of the Japanese B.League.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== College career ==<br/><br/>Born in Zambales, Philippines, Washington played for the Eckerd College Tritons during his college career. In 2002, he had per-game averages of 20.5 pts (on 36% 3PT shooting) and 3.9 rebs in 32 games. He then raised his averages to 21.7 pts and 5.5 rebs in 32 games the next season.

Despite putting good numbers, high expectations and the deep rotation of Talk 'N Text led him to being traded to the San Miguel Beermen in 2008 in exchange for the draft rights of 2008 3rd overall pick Jayson Castro. During the 2010 PBA Fiesta Conference, he was awarded the Best Player of the Conference. He is a three-time Mythical First Team Awardee in the PBA.
