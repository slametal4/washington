            Ruston is a city in Pierce County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,055 at the 2020 census.<br/><br/>Although it is nearly indistinguishable from the adjacent city of Tacoma, the predominantly residential area still retains its status as a separate municipality long after it ceased to be a company town. The local government opted to reclassify Ruston as a city in late 2012.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1890, industrialist William R. Rust established Tacoma Smelting &amp; Refining Company and a company town named the "Smelter District". The company took over an existing smelter that had opened two years earlier and began refining lead; it expanded to more than 300 employees by 1905, with most living in the Smelter District. In 1906, Rust proposed the creation of a new city, which residents named "Ruston" in his honor. Ruston was officially incorporated as a city on November 10, 1906, surrounded on one side by Commencement Bay and all other sides the city of Tacoma.<br/><br/>The Tacoma Smelting &amp; Refining Company was acquired by the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO) in 1905 and its Ruston facility was converted for copper smelting. A prominent brick smokestack was constructed in 1917 and originally measured 571 feet (174 m) in height and was the tallest in the world until it was reduced to 562 feet (171 m) following earthquake damage in 1937.
