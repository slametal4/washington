            For Washington is a 1911 American silent short historical fiction drama film produced by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a fictional account of how a patriotic maid's home is taken over by Hessian officers in the American Revolutionary War. She hides her hatred of them and plies them with drink before delivering a message to George Washington. She leads them in crossing of the Delaware River and the historic capture. The film's crossing scene was inspired by Emmanuel Leutze's 1851 painting Washington Crossing the Delaware. The film was praised by critics, but the notion that the film was purely a historical fiction was lost on some. The film is presumed lost.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot and production ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The film is a historical fiction of the events leading up to George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River. An official synopsis of the film states: "We all know of Washington's remarkable feat in crossing the Delaware River at Trenton with half of his command, surprising the Hessians and making them his prisoners; but how advance word of helplessness of his enemy reached the great general has ever been a matter of much mystery." There is no historical basis for such a claim as critics would highlight.<br/><br/>The film begins with a maid whose home is occupied by the Hessian officers when they enter Trenton.
