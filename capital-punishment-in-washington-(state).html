<h1>Capital punishment in Washington (state)</h1>
            
            The U.S. state of Washington enforced capital punishment until the state's capital punishment statute was declared null and void and abolished in practice by a state Supreme Court ruling on October 11, 2018. The court ruled that it was unconstitutional as applied due to racial bias; however, it did not render the wider institution of capital punishment unconstitutional and rather required the statute to be amended to eliminate racial biases. From 1904 to 2010, 78 people were executed by the state; the last was Cal Coburn Brown on September 10, 2010. In April 2023, Governor Jay Inslee signed SB5087 which formally abolished capital punishment in Washington State and removed provisions for capital punishment from state law.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Legal process ==<br/><br/>When the prosecution sought the death penalty, the sentence was decided by the jury and had to be unanimous.<br/><br/>In case of a hung jury during the penalty phase of the trial, a life sentence would be issued, even if a single juror opposed death (there was no retrial).<br/><br/>The governor had the power of clemency with respect to death sentences.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Capital crimes ==<br/><br/>The following were considered circumstances for aggravated first degree murder:<br/><br/><br/><br/>The victim was a law enforcement officer, corrections officer, or firefighter who was performing his or her official duties at the time of the act resulting in death and the victim was known or reasonably should have been known by the person to be such at the time of the killing.<br/><br/>At the time of the act resulting in the death, the person was serving a term of imprisonment, had escaped, or was on authorized or unauthorized leave in or from a state facility or program for the incarceration or treatment of persons adjudicated guilty of crimes.<br/><br/>At the time of the act resulting in death, the person was in custody in a county or county-city jail as a consequence of having been adjudicated guilty of a felony;<br/><br/>The person committed the murder pursuant to an agreement that he or she would receive money or any other thing of value for committing the murder.
