She has won three ARIA Music Awards with two in 2010 for I Believe You Liar, Best Female Artist and Breakthrough Artist – Release. The other win was Best Cover Art for Batflowers in 2020.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Megan Alexanda Washington was born on 7 January 1986 in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea to Australian parents.
