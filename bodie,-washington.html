            Bodie is a ghost town in Okanogan County, Washington, United States.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Geography ==<br/><br/>Bodie is located approximately 15 miles (24 km) by stagecoach heading north of Wauconda along Toroda Creek (County Road 9495) off Washington State Route 20. Bodie lies 2592 feet (790 m) above sea level.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History of the region ==<br/><br/>In 1886, prospectors Tommy Ryan and Phil Creasor discovered a continuous mineralized ledge in the North of Okanogan County, and claimed the area as Eureka Gulch, which soon after became known as Republic. Republic's rapid heyday boasted seven hotels, twenty saloons, nine general stores, and an undisclosed number of brothels. The quality of ore discovered spurred the existence of many nearby mines and townships, including the near neighbors of Wauconda, Washington, and Bodie.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Bodie, Washington ==<br/><br/>Occupied in early 1888, two years after Ryan and Creasor discovered the lucrative area which became Republic's Knob Hill Mine, high quality ore was extracted, milled and processed right in Bodie until the falling gold prices closed the township's mine and emptied its buildings in 1934, at which time the town had functionally relocated to the Bodie Mining Camp. An estimated US$ 1.2 million in gold was recovered, and it's said that Bodie Creek still runs color. This scenic area, and its related ghost towns, regularly attract historians, mining buffs, and photographers to the slanting buildings, rusty equipment and mysterious log cabins. There is only one intact structure remaining of the original "Old Bodie", a small two story house converted to a storage building with the help of local resident Doug Prichard.
