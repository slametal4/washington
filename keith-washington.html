            Keith Douglas Washington (born November 15, 1960) is an American R&amp;B vocalist from Detroit who recorded the hit single "Kissing You" in 1991. The song was also used as background music for the ABC television soap opera General Hospital. "Kissing You" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance Male and won a 1992 Soul Train Music Award for Best R&amp;B/Soul Single – Male. The song also topped the Billboard Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart for one week. .<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>Prior to his success as a recording act, Washington earned recognition as a songwriter, co-writing Freddie Jackson's 1988 number one R&amp;B hit "Hey Lover".  Within three years, Washington had scored a contract as a solo artist, releasing his debut album, Make Time for Love, in 1991. In addition to "Kissing You", the album featured a number of successful follow-up R&amp;B singles.  He also recorded a duet with Kylie Minogue, their co-composition "If You Were with Me Now", in 1991 (on PWL Records), which reached number 4 in the UK Singles Chart and number 23 in Minogue's native Australia.  Washington's follow-up album, You Make It Easy appeared in 1993, though its success paled in comparison to the debut.  It would be another five years before Washington released his third album, KW, which featured the minor single, "Bring It On".
