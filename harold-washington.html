Washington was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1981 to 1983, representing Illinois's first district. Washington had previously served in the Illinois State Senate and the Illinois House of Representatives from 1965 until 1976.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Ancestry ===<br/><br/>The earliest known ancestor of Harold Lee Washington, Isam/Isham Washington, was born a slave in 1832 in North Carolina.
