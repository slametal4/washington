            Washington is a town in Orange County, Vermont, in the United States. The population was 1,032 at the 2020 census. The town is believed to be named after George Washington, although the town may also be named after Washington, Connecticut, as there are records of individuals moving from that town in Connecticut to Vermont around 1766.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>During the 1760s and 1770s, the territory now known as Vermont was in dispute between New York and New Hampshire, the result of conflicting interpretations of each colony's charter. People moving into the territory, then known as New Connecticut or the New Hampshire Grants, generally settled after purchasing land grants from New Hampshire governor Benning Wentworth. When the British government resolved the dispute in New York's favor, New York attempted to assert control by forcing residents who had purchased grants from Wentworth to pay a fee to confirm their titles, otherwise face eviction. Many Vermonters resisted, leading to creation of the Green Mountain Boys.<br/><br/>As part of New York's effort to demonstrate control over the grants, in 1770 it chartered the town of Kingsland far from New York in what was then remote Gloucester County. Kingsland had no record of any residents, but was designated as one of two county seats. A log jail and courthouse were constructed at the head of a stream subsequently named the Jail Branch.
