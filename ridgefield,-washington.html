The population was 10,319 at the 2020 census, and according to 2023 census estimates, the city is estimated to have a population of 15,027.<br/><br/>Located within the Portland metropolitan area, Ridgefield is notable for the significant Native American history and connection to the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

The community's ties to the Chinookan people was commemorated by the construction of a replica of a Cathlapotle plank house at the nearby Ridgefield National Wildlife Refuge, which was dedicated March 29, 2005.<br/><br/>The town was formerly known as Union Ridge, named by the many Union veterans among the first large wave of settlers after the Civil War and was renamed Ridgefield in 1890. The town's original name is preserved in the name of Union Ridge Elementary School.<br/><br/>Ridgefield was an important trading center as early as the 1860s with its key location near the mouth of the Columbia River, and the city was officially incorporated on August 26, 1909.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Geography ==<br/><br/>According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 7.477 square miles (19.37 km2), of which, 7.402 square miles (19.17 km2) is land and 0.075 square miles (0.19 km2) is water.
