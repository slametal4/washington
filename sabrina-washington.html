            Sabrina Fredrica Washington (born 27 October 1978) is a British singer, actress, and entrepreneur initially known as the lead singer of garage/R&amp;B girl group Mis-Teeq.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Washington was born in Harlesden, on 27 October 1978. Her father was a reggae musician, which influenced her early exposure to music.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Washington's career began in 1999, when she met Alesha Dixon and they joined Dance Attic (a popular dance class school in Fulham, west London), soon becoming a duo. In 2000, when both Alesha and Sabrina were auditioning, they met with Su-Elise Nash and formed a trio. They were signed to Inferno Records with the addition of a new member, Zena McNally, and became the popular UK garage/R&amp;B girl group Mis-Teeq. However, after the release of their debut single "Why?", Zena McNally left the band to pursue her own solo career, and Mis-Teeq were signed to another record deal with Telstar Records.<br/><br/>Ed Nimmervoll writes, "In 2000, the female vocal group known as Mis-teeq took Britain by storm with their debut single, Why? The single was originally an R&amp;B-style tune, but with the aid of garage exponent Matt Jam Lamont, a remix was born which became a smash in the underground garage scene and huge radio hit. Mis-Teeq had made their mark with a unique bend of R&amp;B, garage, and rap.
