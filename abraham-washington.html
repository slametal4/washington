            Brian Bary Jossie (born February 2, 1978), better known by his ring name Abraham Washington (abbreviated A. W.), is an American professional wrestler and former wrestling manager. He is best known for his time in WWE.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Professional wrestling career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE ===<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== Florida Championship Wrestling (2009–2012) ====<br/><br/>Jossie signed a WWE developmental contract, and began working in their developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). In February 2009, he made his FCW debut working under real name, Brian Jossie with no real personality or character. However, he was soon repackaged with a presidential gimmick, and pacted as the FCW General Manager, first under the name Abraham Saddam Washington, before switching to the name Abraham Obama Washington. In March 2010, Washington returned to FCW, with his show, The Abraham Washington Show, and also became an occasional color commentator. On the November 14, 2010, episode of FCW TV Jossie made his in–ring return, wrestling his first match in one and a half years and continued to compete regularly, with FCW.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== ECW (2009–2010) ====<br/><br/>Jossie made his ECW debut on June 30, 2009, using the ring name Abraham Washington, with an in-ring interview segment called The Abraham Washington Show. He interviewed The Bella Twins, causing a fight between the two after they argued over the questions. He went on to interview the likes of Christian, Matt Hardy, Tommy Dreamer, Sheamus, Gregory Helms, John Morrison, Zack Ryder, Goldust, Trent Barreta, Caylen Croft, Yoshi Tatsu and Maria. Hall of Famer Tony Atlas acted as his sidekick and announcer, with the segment taking place from the stage. After the ECW program was cancelled, Jossie became a free agent along with all the other ECW talents, though he never signed with Raw or SmackDown.
