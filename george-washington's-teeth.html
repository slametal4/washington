            George Washington, the first president of the United States, lost all but one of his teeth by the time he was inaugurated, and had at least four sets of dentures he used throughout his life. Made with brass, lead, gold, animal teeth and human teeth — possibly extracted from enslaved persons at Mount Vernon — the dentures were primarily created and attended to by John Greenwood, Washington's dentist.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Natural teeth ==<br/><br/>In 1756, when Washington was 24 years old, a dentist pulled his first tooth. According to his diary, he paid 5 shillings (£0.25, equivalent to $12 in 2024) to a "Doctor Watson" for the removal. His diary also regularly mentioned troubles such as aching teeth and lost teeth. John Adams said that Washington attributed the loss of his teeth to using them to crack walnuts, but modern historians have suggested that calomel, the mineral form of mercury(I) chloride which Washington was given to treat smallpox, probably contributed to the loss.<br/><br/>On April 30, 1789, the day of his first presidential inauguration, although he had mostly dentures, he had only one remaining natural tooth, a premolar. During that same year, he began wearing full dentures.<br/><br/>Washington's last tooth was given as a gift and keepsake to his dentist John Greenwood.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Dentures ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>During his life, George Washington had four sets of dentures.
