            Poussey Washington is a fictional character played by Samira Wiley on the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black. She is a recurring character in the first two seasons and a main character during the third and fourth seasons.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Casting and background ==<br/><br/>Wiley was first told about the auditions for Orange is the New Black by a friend from Juilliard, Marco Ramirez, who was a writer for the show. After she discovered that another Juilliard friend, Danielle Brooks, had won a role in the show, Wiley asked Brooks to rehearse lines with her to prepare for her audition for the role of Poussey Washington, the on-screen best friend of Brooks' character, Tasha "Taystee" Jefferson. Wiley's audition was ultimately successful; she appeared in 12 out of 13 episodes of the series' first season and was featured throughout the second season. Orange Is the New Black is Wiley's first time as a series regular. Wiley stated that she bartended while filming the first season because she didn't know if she would continue to work with the show, mentioning a previous show that she was listed as "recurring" and not being asked to return after the second episode.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Storylines ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Season One ===<br/><br/>Poussey is first seen in the second episode. However, her character is not properly mentioned until the third episode. She has been in prison for two years at the start of the series, with four years to go.
