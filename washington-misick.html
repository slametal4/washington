            Charles Washington Misick  (born 13 March 1950) is a Turks and Caicos Islander politician who has been the 5th Premier of the Turks and Caicos Islands since 20 February 2021. He has been the leader of the Progressive National Party since 20 December 2016. He previously served as the 5th Chief Minister of the Turks and Caicos Islands from 3 April 1991 to 31 January 1995, was Minister of Finance, Trade and Investment from 2012 to 2016 and Leader of the Opposition from 1995 to 2003 and again from 2016 to 2021. Misick has been a MHA for the All Island District since November 2012 and was previously an MHA for Grand Turk from 1991 to 1999.<br/><br/>Misick was educated at West Indies College and studied Business Studies and Business Administration &amp; Accounting at University Technology.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Misick was born on North Caicos on 13 March 1950 and grew up there with his 12 siblings. Misick is the older brother of former Premier, Michael Misick and the uncle of former Minister of Immigration, Donhue Gardiner.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== 2021 general elections ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Leaving politics ===<br/><br/>Since becoming the Leader of the Opposition in 2016, Misick was assuring everyone that he would be leaving politics after his term had come to an end. Thus, it was a surprise to all when he, in early 2019, stood for re-election within the party as its leader for the election to be called. Misick won said election and remained leader as the party geared up for what was expected to be the 2020 general elections.
