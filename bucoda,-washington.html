            Bucoda () is a town in Thurston County, Washington, United States. The population was 600 at the 2020 census. The community refers to itself as the "World's Tiniest Town with the Biggest Halloween Spirit".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Etymology ==<br/><br/>The community was first known as Seatco, an indigenous word meaning evil spirit or devil; the town name became official in 1887 when the community was platted by an early founder, Oliver Shead (Shed). People in the town voiced a dislike of the name and the community was renamed Bucoda in 1890 by act of the state legislature. An accepted theory of the origination of the moniker of Bucoda comes from the taking of the first two letters of the last name of three prominent members of the early town, William Buckley (Buckner), a man recorded with the last name of Coulter, and J.E. Davis (David).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The first American settler at what is now Bucoda was Aaron Webster (1828–1911) who arrived in 1854.  In the 1860s Webster sold his claim and sawmill to Oliver Shead.  The Northern Pacific Railroad located a station at Seatco in 1872. A major flood affecting communities in the Skookumchuck and Chehalis river watersheds occurred in December 1887; two Chehalis residents lost their lives while near the town.
