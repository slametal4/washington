            The Lansdowne portrait is an iconic life-size portrait of George Washington painted by Gilbert Stuart in 1796. It depicts the 64-year-old president of the United States during his final year in office. The portrait was a gift to former British Prime Minister William Petty, 1st Marquess of Lansdowne, and spent more than 170 years in England.<br/><br/>Stuart painted three replicas of the Lansdowne, and five portraits that were closely related to it.: 175  His most famous replica has hung in the East Room of the White House since 1800. Numerous other artists also painted copies.<br/><br/>First Lady Dolley Madison, George Washington Parke Custis and others saved the White House replica from burning in the War of 1812.<br/><br/>In 2001, to preclude the original Lansdowne Portrait's imminent sale at auction by Sotheby's New York, the Smithsonian Institution's National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. purchased it for $20 million with donations from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Jay Treaty ==<br/><br/>The Lansdowne portrait likely (and fancifully) depicts President Washington's December 7, 1795 annual address to the Fourth U.S. Congress.: 172  The highly unpopular Jay Treaty, settling claims between the United States and Great Britain left over from the Revolutionary War, had been presented to the U.S. Senate for approval earlier in the year. The Senate held a special session to debate the treaty in June, at which opposition to it had been fierce. Only two-thirds of the 30 senators (the minimum required under the U.S. Constitution) approved the treaty in mid-August, and Washington, who strongly supported the treaty, signed it in late August.: 172  In his annual address, delivered to Congress on opening day of its next session, the President acknowledged the struggle over the Jay Treaty, and called for unity.
