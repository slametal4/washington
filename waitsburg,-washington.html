            Waitsburg is a city in Walla Walla County, Washington, United States. The population was 1,166 at the 2020 census. Waitsburg has a unique city classification in Washington state, being the state's only city which still operates under its territorial charter.<br/><br/>Located on the Touchet River in an rural area of Southeastern Washington, Waitsburg has long been tied to the agricultural economy of its surrounding region. The milling of wheat played a prominent role in the first century of Waitsburg's existence, though in recent decades the economy has pivoted towards viticulture and tourism due to its location within the Walla Walla AVA. The downtown core of the community, dating to the 1880s, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Waitsburg Historic District.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Prior to settlement by European American pioneers, the area that is now Waitsburg was home to the Palouse people. The juncture of the Touchet River and Coppei Creek, where Waitsburg would eventually develop, was recorded in the journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition during their return trip in 1806. <br/><br/>Waitsburg was first settled in 1859 by Robert Kennedy. Another early settler, Albert Gallatin Lloyd, helped settle persistent confrontations with the Palouse people by negotiating a treaty allowing the native population to camp on the land that he claimed. The arrangement established by that treaty, though not backed up by law, continued informally into the 1940s.
