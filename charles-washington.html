            Charles Washington (May 2, 1738 – September 16, 1799) was an American planter and politician who founded a town in the Shenandoah Valley that was named Charles Town in his honor shortly after his death and that of his eldest brother, George Washington.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early and family life ==<br/><br/>Charles was born near Hunting Creek in Stafford County, Virginia (now Fairfax County) to Augustine Washington (1693-1743) and his second wife, Mary Ball Washington (1708-1789), an orphan and heiress of Col. Joseph Ball of Lancaster County, Virginia. His father died when he was five years old. His eldest half-brother Lawrence Washington (1718-1752) returned from England (where he was being educated), took charge of most of his father's property as well as his underage half-siblings (including Charles, who would receive a private education locally, as was becoming the custom for children of his class), and also became the colony's Adjutant-General and one of Fairfax County's (part-time) representatives in the House of Burgesses.<br/><br/>In 1757, having reached legal age, Charles married Mildred Thornton, daughter of Colonel Francis Thornton and Frances Gregory. They had four children: <br/><br/><br/><br/>George Augustine Washington<br/><br/>Frances Washington<br/><br/>Samuel Washington<br/><br/>Mildred Gregory Washington<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>When Charles Washington reached legal age, he inherited 750 acres of land in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, per his late father's will. In 1761 he purchased two lots in the town of Fredericksburg, the Spotsylvania County seat, and built a house, which exists today but is known as the historic "Rising Sun Tavern." In 1773 he bought an additional 200 acres in Spotsylvania County. Though his parents' youngest son, Charles also inherited considerable property in what was then vast Frederick County, Virginia, because his eldest half-brother, Lawrence Washington, died without any surviving children (and his widow died in 1761). Charles operated such of his property already developed into farms using enslaved labor, and would in 1780 move to the Shenandoah Valley and develop much of that property to farms also using enslaved labor.
