            Jesse Washington was a seventeen-year-old African American farmhand who was lynched in the county seat of Waco, Texas, on May 15, 1916, in what became a well-known example of lynching. Some people have claimed that Washington may have had Native American ancestry, but this has not been widely documented in historical records. <br/><br/>Washington was convicted of raping and murdering Lucy Fryer, the wife of his employer in rural Robinson, Texas. He was chained by his neck and dragged out of the county court by observers. He was then paraded through the street, all while being stabbed and beaten, before being held down and castrated. He was then lynched in front of Waco's city hall.<br/><br/>Over 10,000 spectators, including city officials and police, gathered to watch the attack. There was a celebratory atmosphere among the people at the spectacle of the murder, and many children attended during their lunch hour. Members of the mob cut off his fingers and hung him over a bonfire after saturating him with coal oil. He was repeatedly lowered and raised over the fire for about two hours.
