            Washington Week, originally titled as Washington Week in Review and billed as Washington Week with the Atlantic since 2023, is an American public affairs television program, which has aired on PBS and its predecessor, National Educational Television, since 1967. The program is produced by WETA-TV in Washington, D.C. Since 2023, the program has been moderated by Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic. Unlike other panel discussion shows, which encourage informal (sometimes vociferous) debates as a means of presentation, Washington Week consistently follows a path of civility and moderation. Its format is that of a roundtable featuring the show's moderator and two to four Washington-based journalists.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Washington Week in Review was first broadcast on February 23, 1967, on National Educational Television and was picked up by PBS in 1970. Since its first episode in 1967, the program's announcer has been Paul Anthony.<br/><br/>In 1999, Dalton Delan fired Ken Bode. On October 1, 1999, Gwen Ifill became the host of the program until her death on November 14, 2016. A successor was not announced immediately. Ifill shortened the program's name when she took over, as a sign that "the show would spend more time looking forward." On April 20, 2017, WETA announced that Robert Costa of The Washington Post would become the next moderator of Washington Week.
