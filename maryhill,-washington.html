            Maryhill is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Klickitat County, Washington, United States. The population was 55 at the 2020 census.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Maryhill is named after the wife and daughter of regional icon Sam Hill, who purchased land and envisioned a community there shortly after the turn of the 20th century. Earlier the area was known as "Columbia" or "Columbus". In 1909, the Klickitat County commissioners had accepted the town's name as "Maryland" - proposed by Sam Hill and Associates who had laid out the town. However, this name was rejected by postal authorities as they would not accept a name corresponding to a state, so it was renamed "Maryhill".<br/><br/>Hill used his Maryhill property to build the first paved roads in the Pacific Northwest, the Maryhill Museum of Art (originally intended as a grand residence for the Hills), Maryhill Stonehenge, a monument to the World War I casualties of Klickitat County in the form of a Stonehenge replica, and a planned community. Born a Quaker, Hill hoped to attract a Quaker community to eastern Washington. His plans never materialized and the town buildings he constructed burned down several years later.<br/><br/>Hill intended the Stonehenge replica to express that modern warfare was a form of needless human sacrifice, referencing the contemporary belief that Stonehenge was a sacrificial site.
