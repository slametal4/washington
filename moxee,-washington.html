            Moxee is a small suburban community southeast of Yakima, Washington. Yakima and Moxee are both north of the Yakama Indian Reservation in Yakima County, Washington, United States. The population of Moxee was 4,326 at the 2020 census.<br/><br/>According to the Washington State Office of Financial Management, Moxee ranked 5th of 279 eligible incorporated communities in population growth between 2000 and 2005.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Moxee was first settled by Mortimer Thorp and several French-Canadian farmers who arrived in 1867. A warm spring on the Thorp ranch emitted steam year 'round and never froze. It was known as "Moxee" by the native people, a Sahaptin word for an edible root, and was the name was adopted for the settlement. Over time, the community has been variously known as: "Artesian", "Moksee", "Moxie", "Moxee City", and "Moxee."<br/><br/>The sandy soil and mild climate of the region were ideal for growing hops used in the brewing of beer, and for growing grapes. By the turn-of-the century, the Northern Pacific Railroad had completed a railway line nearby and irrigation projects were being constructed making rich farmland available to new settlers. This attracted more French and French-Canadian farmers who had first immigrated to northern Minnesota and northern Michigan.
