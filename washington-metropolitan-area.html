            The Washington metropolitan area, also referred to as the National Capital Region, Greater Washington, or locally as the DMV (short for District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia), is the metropolitan area comprising Washington, D.C., the federal capital of the United States, and its surroundings. The metropolitan area includes all of Washington, D.C., and parts of Maryland and Virginia. It anchors the southern end of the densely populated Northeast megalopolis and is part of the Washington–Baltimore combined statistical area, the country's third-largest. The area's estimated total population of 6,304,975 (as of 2023) makes it the country's seventh-most populous metropolitan area It is one of the country's most educated and affluent metropolitan areas.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Nomenclature ==<br/><br/>The U.S. Office of Management and Budget defines the area as the Washington–Arlington–Alexandria, DC–VA–MD–WV metropolitan statistical area, a metropolitan statistical area used for statistical purposes by the United States Census Bureau and other agencies. The region's three largest cities are the federal city of Washington, D.C., the county (and census-designated place) of Arlington, and the independent city of Alexandria. The Office of Management and Budget also includes the metropolitan statistical area as part of the larger Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area, which has a population of 9,546,579 as of the 2014 Census Estimate.<br/><br/>The Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia portions of the metropolitan area are sometimes referred to as the National Capital Region, particularly by federal agencies such as the military, Department of Homeland Security, and some local government agencies. The National Capital Region portion of the Washington metropolitan area is also colloquially known by the abbreviation "DMV", which stands for the "District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia." Interstate 495, the Capital Beltway, is at the center of the region. This is the source of the term Inside the Beltway, referring to Federal government insiders and related interests.
